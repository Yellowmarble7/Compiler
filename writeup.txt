CS 4318 

2. Group Contributions
Magdalena Mata - Implemented the remaining scanner rules (identifiers, numbers, characters, strings, comments), handled line and column tracking, and performed debugging to ensure correct token recognition.

Julie Torres - Contributed the initial implementation of rules (keywords, operations, characters, numbers, comments) in scanner.l.

3. Test Examples
Example 1:
Input: int x = 42;
Expected Output: Tokens recognized: KWD_INT, ID(x), OPER_ASGN, INTCONST(42), SEMICLN

Example 2:
Input: char c = '\n';
Expected Output: Tokens recognized: KWD_CHAR, ID(c), OPER_ASGN, CHARCONST('\n'), SEMICLN

4. Extra Grading Instructions
I am not using a makefile. To compile and run, use:
flex scanner.l
gcc lex.yy.c driver.c -o scanner
./scanner < inputfile

Had issues with Flex complaining about the comment and unterminated comment regexes, went for correctness.


5. File Descriptions

5.1 scanner.l
- Implements the Flex scanner for the mC language
- Recognizes identifiers, integers, characters, strings, keywords, operators, punctuation, and comments
- Tracks line and column numbers for each token
- Processes string escape sequences (\n, \t, \", \\) and reports errors for illegal sequences
- Handles unterminated strings and comments with proper error messages
- Calls processString() to convert string literals into their proper escaped form and store in yylval.strVal
- Skips whitespace and newlines properly

5.2 tokendef.h
- Defines all token constants for identifiers, literals, keywords, operators, punctuation, and errors
- Defines the YYSTYPE union for passing token values (integers, characters, strings) from the lexer to driver.c
- Declares global variables like yylval and startCol used by the scanner and driver

5.3 driver.c
- Reads an input file (or stdin) and calls yylex() to get tokens
- Prints each recognized token along with its line and column number in the format <TOKEN_TYPE, value> : (line:col)
- Handles errors and illegal tokens by printing <ERROR, message> : (line:col)
- Loops through the entire input until the end-of-file is reached
